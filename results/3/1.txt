Two alerts were issued by the system. The first alert indicated a successful database backup at 3:00 AM, showing automated maintenance tasks are run regularly. A second alert warned of high CPU usage exceeding 90% for 10 minutes, potentially due to software bugs, hardware limitations, or resource-intensive processes running in the background. This suggests heavy utilization that could impact system performance and reliability. The system's ability to detect and report these issues is crucial for preventing downtime and ensuring overall system integrity.
